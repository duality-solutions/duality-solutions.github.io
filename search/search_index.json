Note Always use absolute paths to configure and compile Dynamic and the dependencies, for example, when specifying the the path of the dependency: ../dist/configure --enable-cxx --disable-shared --with-pic --prefix=$BDB_PREFIX Here BDB_PREFIX must absolute path - it is defined using $(pwd) which ensures the usage of the absolute path. To Build ./autogen.sh ./configure make make install # optional This will build dynamic-qt as well if the dependencies are met. Dependencies These dependencies are required: Library Purpose Description libssl SSL Support Secure communications libboost Boost C++ Library libevent Networking OS independent asynchronous networking Optional dependencies: Library Purpose Description miniupnpc UPnP Support Firewall-jumping support libdb4.8 Berkeley DB Wallet storage (only needed when wallet enabled) qt GUI GUI toolkit (only needed when GUI enabled) protobuf Payments in GUI Data interchange format used for payment protocol (only needed when GUI enabled) libqrencode QR codes in GUI Optional for generating QR codes (only needed when GUI enabled) libzmq3 ZMQ notification Optional, allows generating ZMQ notifications (requires ZMQ version >= 4.x) For the versions used in the release, see release-process.md under Fetch and build inputs . System requirements C++ compilers are memory-hungry. It is recommended to have at least 3 GB of memory available when compiling Dynamic. Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian Build requirements: sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config libssl-dev libcrypto++-dev libevent-dev git for Ubuntu 12.04 and later or Debian 7 and later libboost-all-dev has to be installed: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev db4.8 packages are available here . You can add the repository using the following command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin sudo apt-get update Ubuntu 12.04 and later have packages for libdb5.1-dev and libdb5.1++-dev, but using these will break binary wallet compatibility, and is not recommended. for Debian 7 (Wheezy) and later: The oldstable repository contains db4.8 packages. Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list, replacing [mirror] with any official debian mirror. deb http://[mirror]/debian/ oldstable main To enable the change run sudo apt-get update for other Debian & Ubuntu (with ppa): sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev Optional (see --with-miniupnpc and --enable-upnp-default): sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev ZMQ dependencies (provides ZMQ API 4.x): sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev Dependencies for the GUI: Ubuntu & Debian If you want to build Dynamic-Qt, make sure that the required packages for Qt development are installed. Qt 5 is necessary to build the GUI. If both Qt 4 and Qt 5 are installed, Qt 5 will be used. Pass --with-gui=qt5 to configure to choose Qt5. To build without GUI pass --without-gui . For Qt 5 you need the following: sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libcrypto++-dev libqrencode (optional) can be installed with: sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev Once these are installed, they will be found by configure and a dynamic-qt executable will be built by default. Notes The release is built with GCC and then \"strip dynamicd\" to strip the debug symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%. miniupnpc miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping. It can be downloaded from here . UPnP support is compiled in and turned off by default. See the configure options for upnp behavior desired: --without-miniupnpc No UPnP support miniupnp not required --disable-upnp-default (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime --enable-upnp-default UPnP support turned on by default at runtime To build: tar -xzvf miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz cd miniupnpc-1.6 make sudo su make install Berkeley DB It is recommended to use Berkeley DB 4.8. If you have to build it yourself: DYNAMIC_ROOT=$(pwd) # Pick some path to install BDB to, here we create a directory within the dynamic directory BDB_PREFIX=\"${DYNAMIC_ROOT}/db4\" mkdir -p $BDB_PREFIX # Fetch the source and verify that it is not tampered with wget 'http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz' echo '12edc0df75bf9abd7f82f821795bcee50f42cb2e5f76a6a281b85732798364ef db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz' | sha256sum -c # -> db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz: OK tar -xzvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz # Build the library and install to our prefix cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/ # Note: Do a static build so that it can be embedded into the exectuable, instead of having to find a .so at runtime ../dist/configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx make sudo make install # Configure Dynamic to use our own-built instance of BDB cd $DYNAMIC_ROOT ./configure (other args...) LDFLAGS=\"-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib/\" CPPFLAGS=\"-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include/\" Note : You only need Berkeley DB if the wallet is enabled (see the section Disable-Wallet mode below). Boost If you need to build Boost yourself: sudo su ./bootstrap.sh ./bjam install Security To help make your Dynamic installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to exploit even if a vulnerability is found, binaries are hardened by default. This can be disabled with: Hardening Flags: ./configure --enable-hardening ./configure --disable-hardening Hardening enables the following features: Position Independent Executable Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located. The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be randomly located as well. On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error such as: \"relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;\" To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use: scanelf -e ./dynamicd The output should contain: TYPE ET_DYN Non-executable Stack If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if vulnerable buffers are found. By default, dynamic should be built with a non-executable stack but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an executable without the non-executable stack protection. To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use: scanelf -e ./dynamicd the output should contain: STK/REL/PTL RW- R-- RW- The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable. Disable-wallet mode When the intention is to run only a P2P node without a wallet, dynamic may be compiled in disable-wallet mode with: ./configure --disable-wallet In this case there is no dependency on Berkeley DB 4.8. Mining is also possible in disable-wallet mode, but only using the getblocktemplate RPC call not getwork . AVX2 Mining Optimisations For increased performance when mining, AVX2 optimisations can be enabled. At configure time: --enable-avx2 CPU's with AVX2 support: Intel Haswell processor, Q2 2013 Haswell E processor, Q3 2014 Broadwell processor, Q4 2014 Broadwell E processor, Q3 2016 Skylake processor, Q3 2015 Kaby Lake processor, Q3 2016(ULV mobile)/Q1 2017(desktop/mobile) Coffee Lake processor, expected in 2017 Cannonlake processor, expected in 2018 AMD Carrizo processor, Q2 2015 Ryzen processor, Q1 2017 AVX512 Mining Optimisations For increased performance when mining, AVX512 optimisations can be enabled.

Preparation You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. XCode should be available on your OS X installation media, but if not, you can get the current version from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/. If you install Xcode 4.3 or later, you'll need to install its command line tools. This can be done in Xcode > Preferences > Downloads > Components and generally must be re-done or updated every time Xcode is updated. After installing Xcode, start the application, accept the agreement and then close the application.

Building requirements for Unix based Systems : 3GB Note Always use absolute paths to configure and compile Sequence and the dependencies, for example, when specifying the the path of the dependency: ../dist/configure --enable-cxx --disable-shared --with-pic --prefix=$BDB_PREFIX Here BDB_PREFIX must absolute path - it is defined using $(pwd) which ensures the usage of the absolute path. To Build ./autogen.sh ./configure make make install # optional This will build sequence-qt as well if the dependencies are met. Dependencies These dependencies are required: Library Purpose Description libssl SSL Support Secure communications libboost Boost C++ Library Optional dependencies: Library Purpose Description miniupnpc UPnP Support Firewall-jumping support libdb4.8 Berkeley DB Wallet storage (only needed when wallet enabled) qt GUI GUI toolkit (only needed when GUI enabled) protobuf Payments in GUI Data interchange format used for payment protocol (only needed when GUI enabled) libqrencode QR codes in GUI Optional for generating QR codes (only needed when GUI enabled) For the versions used in the release, see release-process.md under Fetch and build inputs . System requirements C++ compilers are memory-hungry. It is recommended to have at least 1 GB of memory available when compiling Sequence. With 512MB of memory or less compilation will take much longer due to swap thrashing. Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian Build requirements: sudo apt-get install git build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config libssl-dev libcrypto++-dev libevent-dev for Ubuntu 12.04 and later or Debian 7 and later libboost-all-dev has to be installed: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev db4.8 packages are available here . You can add the repository using the following command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin sudo apt-get update Ubuntu 12.04 and later have packages for libdb5.1-dev and libdb5.1++-dev, but using these will break binary wallet compatibility, and is not recommended. for Debian 7 (Wheezy) and later: The oldstable repository contains db4.8 packages. Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list, replacing [mirror] with any official debian mirror. deb http://[mirror]/debian/ oldstable main To enable the change run sudo apt-get update for other Debian & Ubuntu (with ppa): sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev Optional: sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev (see --with-miniupnpc and --enable-upnp-default) Dependencies for the GUI: Ubuntu & Debian If you want to build Sequence-Qt, make sure that the required packages for Qt development are installed. Qt 5 is necessary to build the GUI. If both Qt 4 and Qt 5 are installed, Qt 5 will be used. Pass --with-gui=qt5 to configure to choose Qt5. To build without GUI pass --without-gui . For Qt 5 you need the following: sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libcrypto++-dev libqrencode (optional) can be installed with: sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev Once these are installed, they will be found by configure and a sequence-qt executable will be built by default. Notes The release is built with GCC and then \"strip sequenced\" to strip the debug symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%. miniupnpc miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping. It can be downloaded from here . UPnP support is compiled in and turned off by default. See the configure options for upnp behavior desired: --without-miniupnpc No UPnP support miniupnp not required --disable-upnp-default (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime --enable-upnp-default UPnP support turned on by default at runtime To build: tar -xzvf miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz cd miniupnpc-1.6 make sudo su make install Berkeley DB It is recommended to use Berkeley DB 4.8.

LDFLAGS=\"-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib/\" CPPFLAGS=\"-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include/\" Note : You only need Berkeley DB if the wallet is enabled (see the section Disable-Wallet mode below). Boost If you need to build Boost yourself: sudo su ./bootstrap.sh ./bjam install Security To help make your Sequence installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to exploit even if a vulnerability is found, binaries are hardened by default. This can be disabled with: Hardening Flags: ./configure --enable-hardening ./configure --disable-hardening Hardening enables the following features: Position Independent Executable Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located. The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be randomly located as well. On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error such as: \"relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;\" To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use: scanelf -e ./sequenced The output should contain: TYPE ET_DYN Non-executable Stack If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if vulnerable buffers are found. By default, sequence should be built with a non-executable stack but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an executable without the non-executable stack protection. To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use: scanelf -e ./sequenced the output should contain: STK/REL/PTL RW- R-- RW- The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable. Disable-wallet mode When the intention is to run only a P2P node without a wallet, sequence may be compiled in disable-wallet mode with: ./configure --disable-wallet In this case there is no dependency on Berkeley DB 4.8. Mining is also possible in disable-wallet mode, but only using the getblocktemplate RPC call not getwork .

As such, Duality needs a way to self-regulate the decentralized blockchain. The fluid protocol is the answer to the problem mentioned above without going through contentious hard forking scenarios. The core of the protocol, as of right now, can generate or mint new coins, change Dynode rewards, and change miner rewards. In the future, other additional changes to the consensus rules will follow. Fluid Protocol Use Case The market demand for alternative methods of money is present and here to stay with the advent of the Internet, the 2008 market crash, and overall lack of government accountability. Digital currencies are the answer to the rising needs of the market. In late 2008-2009, Bitcoin was the response of unaccountable government from the brilliant mind of Satoshi Nakamoto. While fast transactions, no middle-men, and cryptographic proofs provided transparency in Bitcoin, it did not offer the same level of features that the market wanted. The market enjoys regulatory oversight, uniform rules among a shared jurisdiction, and arbitration. Duality Solutions is responding to such market needs with self-regulation, added arbitration features, and voluntary governance. Duality uniquely understands the shifting needs of the market investor, and the Fluid protocol is the solution to address those needs. The Fluid protocol is a mechanism to change the consensus rules of Duality\u2019s blockchain, Dynamic, to enforce self-regulation, change the reward amounts for Dynode holders and miners, and respond to arbitration. From a technical level, there are five sovereign wallets, think of them as arbitrators, who need three out of five sovereign wallets signatures to make a decision. In essence, a counterparty mechanism to prevent abuse from malicious users. In traditional banking and finance, banks and third parties are the ultimate approval mechanisms for transactions and changes within the financial network. The way to traverse and avoid the need for a final arbitrator is by spreading the power among multiple, vested parties. In digital currencies, this is called counterparty risk, and multi-signature wallets, which is an account where a specified amount of people out of the total amount are needed to move the funds out of the wallet, are the solution for addressing counterparty risk. The Fluid protocol is that for the Dynamic blockchain. Technical Documentation The writer assumes the reader has a basic understanding of the Dynamic blockchain, wallet addresses, and Dynodes. The Fluid protocol gives \u201csovereign\u201d wallet addresses control of the blockchain\u2019s parameters, multi-signature addresses for the blockchain, using specific transactions. Usually, it requires a hard fork to change the consensus rules for a blockchain such as changing the rewards. With Fluid, static consensus rules change when 3 out of 5 sovereign wallet addresses sign a Fluid transaction. Fluid transactions perform the following actions in the current implementation: Generate or mint new coins Change Dynode rewards Change miner rewards Future upgrades will allow Fluid to: Zero out a wallet address balance (by sending a negative txout). Ban a wallet address or Blockchain Directory Access Protocol (BDAP) account Adjust standard transaction and BDAP registration fees Add, remove, and swap sovereign address Workflow: Currently, there are only RPC commands to create and view Fluid transactions. To run the examples on testnet, you will need to import the private keys for at least three sovereign testnet wallet address. All Fluid transaction cost 100,000 DYN to run so you will need to verify you have the balance when you send the transaction in the last step.

As such, Duality needs a way to self-regulate the decentralized blockchain. The fluid protocol is the answer to the problem mentioned above without going through contentious hard forking scenarios. The core of the protocol, as of right now, can generate or mint new coins, change Dynode rewards, and change miner rewards. In the future, other additional changes to the consensus rules will follow.","title":"Executive Summary:"},{"location":"fluid-protocol/#fluid-protocol-use-case","text":"The market demand for alternative methods of money is present and here to stay with the advent of the Internet, the 2008 market crash, and overall lack of government accountability. Digital currencies are the answer to the rising needs of the market. In late 2008-2009, Bitcoin was the response of unaccountable government from the brilliant mind of Satoshi Nakamoto. While fast transactions, no middle-men, and cryptographic proofs provided transparency in Bitcoin, it did not offer the same level of features that the market wanted. The market enjoys regulatory oversight, uniform rules among a shared jurisdiction, and arbitration. Duality Solutions is responding to such market needs with self-regulation, added arbitration features, and voluntary governance. Duality uniquely understands the shifting needs of the market investor, and the Fluid protocol is the solution to address those needs. The Fluid protocol is a mechanism to change the consensus rules of Duality\u2019s blockchain, Dynamic, to enforce self-regulation, change the reward amounts for Dynode holders and miners, and respond to arbitration. From a technical level, there are five sovereign wallets, think of them as arbitrators, who need three out of five sovereign wallets signatures to make a decision. In essence, a counterparty mechanism to prevent abuse from malicious users. In traditional banking and finance, banks and third parties are the ultimate approval mechanisms for transactions and changes within the financial network. The way to traverse and avoid the need for a final arbitrator is by spreading the power among multiple, vested parties. In digital currencies, this is called counterparty risk, and multi-signature wallets, which is an account where a specified amount of people out of the total amount are needed to move the funds out of the wallet, are the solution for addressing counterparty risk. The Fluid protocol is that for the Dynamic blockchain.","title":"Fluid Protocol Use Case"},{"location":"fluid-protocol/#technical-documentation","text":"The writer assumes the reader has a basic understanding of the Dynamic blockchain, wallet addresses, and Dynodes. The Fluid protocol gives \u201csovereign\u201d wallet addresses control of the blockchain\u2019s parameters, multi-signature addresses for the blockchain, using specific transactions. Usually, it requires a hard fork to change the consensus rules for a blockchain such as changing the rewards. With Fluid, static consensus rules change when 3 out of 5 sovereign wallet addresses sign a Fluid transaction. Fluid transactions perform the following actions in the current implementation: Generate or mint new coins Change Dynode rewards Change miner rewards Future upgrades will allow Fluid to: Zero out a wallet address balance (by sending a negative txout). Ban a wallet address or Blockchain Directory Access Protocol (BDAP) account Adjust standard transaction and BDAP registration fees Add, remove, and swap sovereign address Workflow: Currently, there are only RPC commands to create and view Fluid transactions. To run the examples on testnet, you will need to import the private keys for at least three sovereign testnet wallet address. All Fluid transaction cost 100,000 DYN to run so you will need to verify you have the balance when you send the transaction in the last step.","title":"Technical Documentation"},{"location":"fluid-protocol/#fluid-rpc-calls","text":"burndynamic \"amount\" \"account\" consenttoken \"address\" \"tokenkey\" getfluidhistory getfluidhistoryraw getfluidsovereigns gettime getrawpubkey \"address\" maketoken \"amount\" \"time\" \"receive address\" sendfluidtransaction \"hexstring\" signtoken \"address\" \"tokenkey\" verifyquorum \"tokenkey\"","title":"Fluid RPC Calls"},{"location":"fluid-protocol/#fluid-protocol-code","text":"All of the code for the fluid protocol can be found in these files: fluid.h fluid.cpp rpcfluid.cpp","title":"Fluid Protocol Code"},{"location":"fluid-protocol/#importing-a-sovereign-wallet-address","text":"The Dynamic testnet has 5 initial sovereign wallet addresses.
